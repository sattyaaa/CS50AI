# CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Projects

This repository contains my solutions for the projects from Harvard University's CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course. Each project is organized by week and topic, showcasing various AI techniques and algorithms.

## ü§ñ Projects Overview

Here is a breakdown of the projects, organized by the week they were assigned.

### Week 0: Search
This week focused on search algorithms, which are used to find solutions to problems by exploring possible states.

* **Degrees:** Implemented a search algorithm to find the shortest path between any two actors by their shared movie appearances (solving the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" problem).
    * **Concepts:** Breadth-First Search (BFS), Graph Traversal, Data Structures.
* **Tic-Tac-Toe:** Developed an AI that can play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.
    * **Concepts:** Minimax Algorithm, Game Theory, Recursion, Optimal Strategy.

### Week 1: Knowledge
This week explored how to represent information symbolically and use that knowledge to draw logical inferences.

* **Knights:** Solved logic puzzles by representing knowledge about the characters (knights and knaves) using propositional logic.
    * **Concepts:** Propositional Logic, Knowledge Representation, Logical Inference, Model Checking.
* **Minesweeper:** Created an AI agent that can play the game Minesweeper by making logical deductions based on the game state.
    * **Concepts:** Knowledge-Based Agents, Inference, Constraint Satisfaction.

### Week 2: Uncertainty
This week covered probabilistic reasoning, allowing an AI to handle uncertainty and make decisions based on likelihood.

* **PageRank:** Implemented the PageRank algorithm, which Google famously used to rank web pages based on the probability that a user would click through links.
    * **Concepts:** Markov Chains, Probability Distributions, Iterative Algorithms.
* **Heredity:** Wrote a program to predict the probability of a person having a certain genetic trait or gene based on their family tree.
    * **Concepts:** Bayesian Networks, Conditional Probability, Inference by Enumeration.

### Week 3: Optimization
This week was about optimization problems, where the goal is to find the best solution from a large set of possibilities.

* **Crossword:** Created a program to generate crossword puzzles automatically by treating it as a constraint satisfaction problem.
    * **Concepts:** Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), Backtracking Search, Arc Consistency.

### Week 4: Learning
This week introduced the fundamentals of machine learning, focusing on teaching a computer to learn from data.

* **Shopping:** Built a machine learning model to predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase.
    * **Concepts:** Classification, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Data Preprocessing.
* **Nim:** Wrote an AI that learns to play the game of Nim through reinforcement learning. The AI starts with no knowledge and learns the optimal strategy by playing thousands of games against itself.
    * **Concepts:** Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning, Unsupervised Learning.

### Week 5: Neural Networks
This week dove into neural networks, a powerful machine learning model inspired by the structure of the human brain.

* **Traffic:** Constructed a deep neural network to classify traffic signs from a dataset of images.
    * **Concepts:** Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), TensorFlow/Keras, Image Classification.

### Week 6: Language
The final week focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling computers to understand and process human language.

* **Parser:** Implemented a program to parse sentences and extract meaning from them based on grammatical rules.
    * **Concepts:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), Context-Free Grammar, Parsing, Noun Phrase Chunking.
* **Questions:** Built a question-answering system that can read a corpus of text documents and provide answers to user questions.
    * **Concepts:** Information Retrieval, TF-IDF, Query Formulation.
